# Verilog Dispatcher Workflow

## Entry decision

Treat a request as an Erie Verilog Generator task when it asks for Verilog, RTL, `.v`, `.sv`, FPGA, ASIC, modules, finite-state machines, AXI, AXIS, APB, SPI, I2C, UART, or a hardware interface/register behavior description.

## Task classes

Mark at least one of these classes in the execution plan:

- `generate`: create new synthesizable RTL or a testbench scaffold from a confirmed specification.
- `modify`: change, repair, normalize, or refactor existing RTL.
- `comment`: add, translate, rewrite, or optimize comments only.
- `analyze`: inspect existing RTL, interfaces, risk, or style differences without writing source files.
- `validate`: run static gates, formatter-AST gates, comment-only gates, or optional external simulation/synthesis readiness checks.

Every triggered task must name the applicable public delivery matrix gates: `compile`, `ast`, `readability`, `comment`, `naming`, `profile`, `testbench`, and `toolchain`. Internal tools such as formatter AST, quality gate, comment gate, static lint, interface gate, and optional external validation are evidence sources for that matrix; they are not the public delivery contract.

When implementation work touches Python, first use `readable-python-generator`: classify the task, state the functional intent contract, follow current-project Chinese style, and pass strict readable-python gates before claiming VerilogGenerator readiness. When implementation work touches bat/cmd, shell/bash, PowerShell, or Tcl, first use `readable-script-generator`: identify the language, classify the task, state the script intent contract, and pass strict readable-script gates. Mixed changes must satisfy both paths.

## Execution matrix

### `generate`

Confirm the intent contract first: module name, ports, clock/reset, interface family, behavior, latency/pipeline expectations, reset values, test cases, and deliverable files. Generated RTL must pass the final deliverable gate; model self-review is never enough.

### `modify`

Build a formatter-AST report and risk score for the original RTL before deciding whether to preserve, micro-format, normalize, or fail without writing. Any change touching interfaces, port names, reset polarity, always-block splitting, FSMs, or output bridges must report risk and verification evidence.

Existing RTL modify requests require a real source target. If the target RTL or required context is missing, fail with `TARGET_OR_CODE_REQUIRED` or the nearest equivalent rule. Do not generate placeholder RTL or directly replaceable template patches for an unspecified asset.

### `comment`

Run exactly: `format baseline -> comment draft -> verify comment-only -> deliverable gate -> format final -> verify comment-only`. The script only proves RTL tokens did not change; the agent must still write entity-level comments from real code intent and must not emit template, hollow, or fallback placeholders.

### `analyze`

Read-only analysis must not write source files. It may output AST summaries, style deltas, risk grades, and suggested commands, but suggestions are not executed work.

Existing-asset analysis and reports may locate issues and explain risk, but they must not output drop-in replacement code unless the user has explicitly requested modify/repair and supplied the real target asset.

### `validate`

At minimum, run `python -m scripts.python.validation.verilog_generated_deliverable_gate`. Use strict mode for generated deliverables. Use `python -m scripts.python.quality.verilog_quality_gate` for focused VG debugging only. Use `--non-strict --warn-only` only for historical reference corpora that now live under `tests/cases/ideal/rtl` and `tests/cases/bad/rtl`.

The deliverable gate must expose the eight public checks: `compile`, `ast`, `readability`, `comment`, `naming`, `profile`, `testbench`, and `toolchain`. `compile` means local static parser/lint evidence. Simulator compile, execution, synthesis, and remote validation belong to `toolchain`; they are optional unless the user requests them or configuration enables them, and any requested failure blocks delivery.

Repository regression fixtures live under `tests/cases`. Tests and runtime validation must read that stable corpus and must not rely on the temporary input area used during one-time corpus migration.

## Safe repair boundary

- Do not guess rewrites when the AST cannot identify modules, ports, always blocks, instances, or preprocessor-sensitive structure.
- Do not change RTL tokens, lvalues, ports, instance connections, reset polarity, or always targets during a comment-only workflow.
- Do not drive top-level outputs directly from sequential logic; use an internal output signal and an assign bridge.
- Do not split a multi-target always block unless the AST and normalization path can prove the split is safe enough for the selected profile.
- Do not treat non-strict legacy analysis as approval for generated deliverables.
- Do not classify a `*_good.v` compatibility fixture from the bad corpus as a strict negative case unless its manifest entry explicitly says so.
- Do not claim repair completion until readability and syntax/AST gates pass and strict delivery warnings are clear.
